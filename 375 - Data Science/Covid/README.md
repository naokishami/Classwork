In this project, we are using data from the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and a Github repo that amasses a time series summary for Covid from each nation. Using all of this data, we are tasked to clean and tidy the data and to use linear modeling to quantify some of the variation in mortality from Covid-19 in different countries due to differences in age demographics and hospital infrastructure.
