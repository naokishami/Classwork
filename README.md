#### About Me
I am a senior at California State University, Fullerton studying Computer Science. I got interested in computers because of my father working as a System Admin.

Technologies that I have used:
- Python
  - numPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter notebooks
- C++/C
  - openMP, MPI, CUDA
- R
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Vue
- Java
- MySQL
- Google Firebase

Areas I have developed in:
- Web development
- OS threads
- High Performance Computing
