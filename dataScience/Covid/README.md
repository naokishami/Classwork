In this project, we are taking data from the World Health Organization, World Bank, and the John Hopkins Covid-19 dataset from Github. From this data, we are tidying it so that is in a long format (tidy) and also joining these tables so that we can perform data analysis. We are using linear modeling to quantify some of the variation in mortality from Covid-19 in different countries due to differences in age demographics and hospital infrastructure. 

In the plots folder, you'll find all the plots that I have created with my linear model.
